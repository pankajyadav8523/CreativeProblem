Pseaudo Code of local minima of binary tree -
a) Just Finding one local minima
1. Starts from root find it's children value, if both are greater then root will be minima.
2. if one small and other or greater, move in the direction of small child and check it's children, if both are smaller then report the local minima (left or right).
3. if we move in the direction of always greater child w.r.t root then we will never get local minima.
if we have self balanced binary tree and we find local minima after traversing the node in only one direction either left or right w.r.t root then time complexity will be log(n).
otherwise it will take O(n) time in the worst case.
